/**
 Asynchronously generates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the specified width and height, introducing edges based on a given probability.
 The function creates nodes in rows, connecting each node from the current row to nodes in the next row with a probability defined by the parameter.

 - Parameters:
 - width: The number of nodes in each row.
 - height: The number of rows in the graph.
 - probability: The probability (percentage) of creating an edge between nodes in consecutive rows. Defaults to 10.

 - Returns: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the specified width, height, and edge probability.
